Nathan Underwood - Module 4 Challenge

This Challenge gives me the opportunity to build my own coding quiz from scratch.

Building this password generator allowed me the opporutnity to practice and demonstrate my knowledge of scope. Adhering to rules of scope was the most challenging part of this project. There were many instances of thinkiing I had the code logic and formatting complete, only to find that a variable/function wasn't being called upon because of scope. However, I enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing the generator work when I correctly formatted the code with scope. It took three different .js files, but I'm greatful for this challenge because it forced me to internalize the interworkings of Javascript. I know the information I learned from this assignment about scope will stay with me for future projects in Javascript.

Here is a short video of what the functioning webpage should look like: Password Generator Runthrough
